### ***Casual Story characters***

**[Zen](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/Zen)**

***“	I'm an actor so there's not much I can do, but I'd love to help anyone who's discouraged by their difficult environment.	”
—ZEN, Comment from RFA Orientation Guidebook***

>   **Zen (real name Hyun Ryu)** is one of the main characters available through the Casual Story in Mystic Messenger. Zen is a semi-successful actor/dancer/singer. He can come across as narcissistic about his looks, often posting selfies and exclaiming how handsome he is. However, while it may seem he cares about his appearance the most, he wants to be recognized and appreciated first and foremost for his career skills.

*Personality*

>> On the surface, Zen is known for being a very eccentric and flirtatious character. He will often talk about his looks, praising and complimenting himself for how attractive he is, as well as how talented he is when it comes to singing and acting. Zen tends to compare others to himself when it comes to looks, frequently telling Yoosung to work out to look half as good as he does. Despite this, Zen can become very loyal and caring, especially to those he cares about. In all routes, he cares deeply for MC. While Zen likes to compliment himself, he often flirts with MC. He usually calls them "sweetie" or "babe".

>> In conjunction, deep down Zen self doubts himself, wondering if people only see him for his looks, rather than his talents. He can be easily upset if something affects his career, almost entering a depressive state.

>> He is known for pursuing larger and better musicals, offering up smaller ones or turning them down if the opportunity presents itself.

>> Like many of the members, he has scars from his past which can't be forgotten.

*Appearance*

>> Zen is a tall young man with noticeable muscle tone due to regular training. He is 182 cm (5'11") tall and his weight is 75 kg (165.3 pounds). He has silver-white long hair with short bangs falling slightly over his eyes, and his hair is tied in a low ponytail which reaches down his back. Zen's eyes are pinkish-red and almond-shaped.

>> He is shown wearing multiple outfits, including a grey jacket with large buttons and a logo feature, a black turtleneck, tight fitting pants and black formal shoes.

**[Yoosung Kim](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/Yoosung)**

***“	I'm so glad we're hosting another party! I'm going to do better than last time so that Rika's not disappointed from up there.	”
—Yoosung, Comment from RFA Orientation Guidebook***

> **Yoosung** is one of the Casual Story characters available in Mystic Messenger. Yoosung is a sophomore college student who plays a game called LOLOL and invests too much time into it. Because of that, he does not spend as much time studying for college and neglects his studies. Yoosung is also the cousin of Rika and cannot fully bring himself to believe that she is not alive anymore.

*Personality*

>> Yoosung is a very nice and lovable person, and is described by the other RFA members as 'a real puppy'. Yoosung cares about people a lot and loves to spend time with others. He is naive and believes things that are told to him more often than not, as shown in several of his interactions with 707. As a result, he is often the target of 707's pranks and teasing.

>> Despite his somewhat naive and lighthearted nature, Yoosung became severely depressed after the death of his cousin, Rika, who he idolized and was very close with. After her death, Yoosung lost all interest in his studies and became a shut in, rarely leaving for classes and opting instead to play LOLOL in order to cope with the crippling sadness.

>> During Yoosung's route, 707 states in a phone call with the MC that Yoosung had yandere tenancies, which the MC can expand on if she wants. This reveals Yoosung to be a very possessive person, asking the MC to only text him, to only call and talk to him. The MC can expand on his yandere tenancies which will result in a Bad Ending if she also encourages him to see her as a new Rika.

*Appearance*

>> He is the shortest out of all the male characters, at 171 cm (5'7") and is also the most youthful appearance and age-wise. He has messy, bleached blond hair that he usually keeps out of his eyes with two dark brown hair clips that form an 'X' shape. He has soft violet eyes and a young aura to him in all his photos. His style of clothing usually contains something blue.

>> It is stated that Yoosung dyed his hair blond in order to get a girlfriend, but also to perhaps look closer in appearance with his cousin who was also blonde. His natural hair colour is a dark brown and was usually well kept. Before Rika's death, it is shown in photos that Yoosung would wear more formal clothes before he went to college.

**[Jaehee Kang](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/Jaehee_Kang)**

***“	Everyone is fairly chatty in the chat room, but we are serious about the organization's party. Hopefully, we can invite many people.	”
—Jaehee Kang, Comment from RFA Orientation Guidebook***

> **Jaehee Kang** is one of the characters available from the Casual Story option in Mystic Messenger, and the only female character with a route. She is the chief secretary in the C&R International company and works as Jumin Han's assistant. She is kind and hardworking.

*Personality*

>> Even though Jaehee is a fairly serious and independent business woman, she is very caring. Jaehee has her own sense of humour and knows how to have a good chuckle at herself and others. That being said, she likes things to be organized and kept in line (One of the reasons she doesn't like taking care of cats; the one hair she misses while cleaning up after them drives her mad). It's very frustrating to her when things do not go according to schedule or if she is saddled with unexpected extra work. But ever the responsible one, she always comes through and deals the best she can despite the challenges her boss and friend Jumin always throws at her both in work and personal life.

*Appearance*

>> Jaehee is a young woman of average height, 165 cm (5'5"), who weighs 54 kg (119 lbs). She has short brown hair and gold-ish brown eyes. She wears non-prescription glasses that were given to her by Jumin. She is often seen in a business suit due to her job. She wears a white dress shirt, a dark brown/black jacket with a short pencil skirt, tights and black heels. In her after-ending, she has long, wavy hair that goes down to her upper back.

### ***Deep Story Characters***

**[707](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/707)**

***“	It's nice to use the messenger, but you'll get hurt if you try to find out too much about me so be careful!	”
—707, Comment from RFA Orientation Guidebook***

***“	Be careful, I am dangerous, you wouldn't want to get too involved with me...	”
— 707, Official profile***

> **707 (Real name Saeyoung Choi, Baptismal name Luciel Choi)** often referred as Seven, is one of the Deep Story characters available in Mystic Messenger. He is a hacker who can quickly find information on anything he can get his hands on.

*Personality*

>> For the most part, Seven displays a happy-go-lucky, outgoing, and very bizarre personality. He frequently plays pranks on Yoosung via chat room, makes fun of the other members (and himself), and, in response to just about anything, will respond with a series of "lol"s. He's essentially your typical jokester who loves cars (he owns multiple) and holds a passion for hacking.

>> However, the player's first impression of Seven is not the "real" Seven. Outside the chat room, and behind the humorous front he puts up, Seven is actually quite depressed and serious, and he refuses to believe that anything good can happen to him. This is due to his past and his profession, as he thinks that he will endanger anyone he gets close to. This fear is brought up very often during the events of his route, usually when he is trying to push the player away.

>> Though he rejects the player at first, it is evident that he values them quite a lot and very readily displays affection when convinced that the player will accept him regardless of how he is. After his route, he returns to his previous self, just toned down a little bit.

>> It is also mentioned that he is Catholic and later in his route he shows his religious values.

*Appearance*

>> Seven has messy vermilion hair and golden eyes. He usually wears a black jacket with amber accents. He is 175 cm (5' 9") tall and weighs 69 kg (152 lbs). He is always seen wearing his glasses, which are yellow with dark grey (sometimes depicted as black) stripes. His orange headphones are seen around his neck the majority of the time. He also wears a silver cross necklace.

>> Seven changes his outfits very rarely. His attire for the party consists of a white vest decorated with red accents over a black dress shirt and a red tie.

>> He crossdresses and cosplays often as the player will be able to obtain pictures of himself in various costumes throughout the game. He has dressed up as Rika, a maid, an astronaut, a fairy, and a nun in the past.

**[Jumin Han](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/Jumin_Han)**

***“	If only we can continue Rika and V's aspirations	”
—Jumin Han, Comment from RFA Orientation Guidebook***

> **Jumin Han** is one of the Deep Story characters available in Mystic Messenger. He is the son of a wealthy family and the heir of the C&R International company. He is always on business trips and usually talks about work or mature topics, which is why he doesn't know about youth slang or commoner food. He does, however, sometimes speak eccentrically. Jumin loves to talk about his cat, Elizabeth 3rd, and how beautiful she is and is very much a doting parent. However, because of past experiences, Jumin is emotionally closed off and is distrustful of women, having witnessed his father fall victim to many gold-diggers who never loved his father, only his money.

*Personality*

>> Jumin is a quiet, serious and cautious man who prefers to act mature. Despite this, he is interested in young slang and loves to talk about cats, especially his own, Elizabeth 3rd. In fact, in his own way, his general cadence will give off that of a child's. He also enjoys teasing Zen about his cat allergy in the chat room. He is often surrounded by rumors concerning his sexuality because of his complete lack of interest in women, leading the press and other members of the RFA to tease him for possibly being gay. He views situations objectively, and wants others to be like him. He is a workaholic, which is shown through how he works Jaehee Kang to the bone; however, Jaehee states that Jumin's workload is ever greater than hers. Jumin disregards others' opinions of him, so he lives his life how he thinks is right.

>> Jumin does not care for relationships because he thinks it isn't worth it, preferring to focus on his work and cat instead. This gives others the impression of a cold man or even a robot. He also keeps his work relationships strictly professional, believing that his employees will do anything as long as they are paid to. As Jumin has a high status, he lives luxuriously, but he hates people that only like him for his money. Jumin has his own sense of humor which most of the RFA members do not understand, and at most times, isn't very funny but he doesn't care. Despite his cold and objective perspective, Jumin treasures the members of RFA so much that when needed, he would use his authority to help them without hesitation.

>> It is revealed in Jumin's Route, that he is not so cold and unfeeling as he portrays himself; instead, he is a man who feels rather too much but, for the sake of efficiency, he pushes his feelings down, repressing them and using work and his cat to distract himself. This has led to Jumin to develop severe, crippling loneliness and he does not know how to work through it, viewing himself as a "monster", thinking himself to be an ugly creature because of how lonely and paranoid he is. To cope, he projected this loneliness onto Elizabeth the 3rd and is overcome with despair when he admits that he knows their relationship is a lie, that she does not understand him and never will. Jumin is also hinted at having feelings for Rika as he believed she could see into him and see the "tangled" emotions without becoming disgusted. However, even when Rika asks if they would have ended up together, Jumin is visibly uncomfortable at the joke and tells her not to say things like that as it makes him uncomfortable. Because of never having been in a relationship before and being forced to repress his emotions, Jumin's relationship with the MC is rocky at first. However, with the MC's help, Jumin overcomes all his fear and anxiety and "untangles" his emotions that were knotted for many years.

*Appearance*

>> Jumin is a tall, young man with a slim body. He is 184 cm (6' 0") tall and he weighs 78 kg (171.9 pounds). He has messy black hair that has a slight brown hue in some pictures. He has the same hairstyle that you would typically see an ahoge have. He has sharp grey eyes and also has a very pale complexion.

>> He is often seen wearing his formal suit even when he is in his penthouse. It consists of a striped long white shirt, a black vest, jacket, tie, pants and shoes. On his right chest on the suit is a little pocket with a violet handkerchief.

>> In the Normal Ending, Jumin is seen wearing his casual attire which consists of a long white shirt covered by a tan sweater, an open dark blue jacket and long black pants which he used to wear when he was the Director of C&R.

>> In the After Ending, Jumin is seen with slicked-back hair (with a slight greyish streak) and his usual attire with his jacket unbuttoned. Jumin's usual black tie is replaced with a dark red one and he wears sunglasses.

>> At the party, Jumin is seen wearing a formal suit, which is more dark blue. He is wearing a white long shirt and white gloves.

> ![Jumin Han_Gallery](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/118145851/202855288-c04e0cff-aa9a-47b4-b3bb-d50081b91706.jpg)
