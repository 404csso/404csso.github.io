### Main characters:
***Casual Story characters***

**[Zen](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/Zen)**

***“	I'm an actor so there's not much I can do, but I'd love to help anyone who's discouraged by their difficult environment.	”
—ZEN, Comment from RFA Orientation Guidebook***

>   **Zen (real name Hyun Ryu)** is one of the main characters available through the Casual Story in Mystic Messenger. Zen is a semi-successful actor/dancer/singer. He can come across as narcissistic about his looks, often posting selfies and exclaiming how handsome he is. However, while it may seem he cares about his appearance the most, he wants to be recognized and appreciated first and foremost for his career skills.

*Personality*

>> On the surface, Zen is known for being a very eccentric and flirtatious character. He will often talk about his looks, praising and complimenting himself for how attractive he is, as well as how talented he is when it comes to singing and acting. Zen tends to compare others to himself when it comes to looks, frequently telling Yoosung to work out to look half as good as he does. Despite this, Zen can become very loyal and caring, especially to those he cares about. In all routes, he cares deeply for MC. While Zen likes to compliment himself, he often flirts with MC. He usually calls them "sweetie" or "babe".

>> In conjunction, deep down Zen self doubts himself, wondering if people only see him for his looks, rather than his talents. He can be easily upset if something affects his career, almost entering a depressive state.

>> He is known for pursuing larger and better musicals, offering up smaller ones or turning them down if the opportunity presents itself.

>> Like many of the members, he has scars from his past which can't be forgotten.

*Appearance*

>> Zen is a tall young man with noticeable muscle tone due to regular training. He is 182 cm (5'11") tall and his weight is 75 kg (165.3 pounds). He has silver-white long hair with short bangs falling slightly over his eyes, and his hair is tied in a low ponytail which reaches down his back. Zen's eyes are pinkish-red and almond-shaped.

>> He is shown wearing multiple outfits, including a grey jacket with large buttons and a logo feature, a black turtleneck, tight fitting pants and black formal shoes.

**[Yoosung Kim](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/Yoosung)**

***“	I'm so glad we're hosting another party! I'm going to do better than last time so that Rika's not disappointed from up there.	”
—Yoosung, Comment from RFA Orientation Guidebook***

> **Yoosung** is one of the Casual Story characters available in Mystic Messenger. Yoosung is a sophomore college student who plays a game called LOLOL and invests too much time into it. Because of that, he does not spend as much time studying for college and neglects his studies. Yoosung is also the cousin of Rika and cannot fully bring himself to believe that she is not alive anymore.

*Personality*

>> Yoosung is a very nice and lovable person, and is described by the other RFA members as 'a real puppy'. Yoosung cares about people a lot and loves to spend time with others. He is naive and believes things that are told to him more often than not, as shown in several of his interactions with 707. As a result, he is often the target of 707's pranks and teasing.

>> Despite his somewhat naive and lighthearted nature, Yoosung became severely depressed after the death of his cousin, Rika, who he idolized and was very close with. After her death, Yoosung lost all interest in his studies and became a shut in, rarely leaving for classes and opting instead to play LOLOL in order to cope with the crippling sadness.

>> During Yoosung's route, 707 states in a phone call with the MC that Yoosung had yandere tenancies, which the MC can expand on if she wants. This reveals Yoosung to be a very possessive person, asking the MC to only text him, to only call and talk to him. The MC can expand on his yandere tenancies which will result in a Bad Ending if she also encourages him to see her as a new Rika.

*Appearance*

>> He is the shortest out of all the male characters, at 171 cm (5'7") and is also the most youthful appearance and age-wise. He has messy, bleached blond hair that he usually keeps out of his eyes with two dark brown hair clips that form an 'X' shape. He has soft violet eyes and a young aura to him in all his photos. His style of clothing usually contains something blue.

>> It is stated that Yoosung dyed his hair blond in order to get a girlfriend, but also to perhaps look closer in appearance with his cousin who was also blonde. His natural hair colour is a dark brown and was usually well kept. Before Rika's death, it is shown in photos that Yoosung would wear more formal clothes before he went to college.

**[Jaehee Kang](https://mystic-messenger.fandom.com/wiki/Jaehee_Kang)**

***“	Everyone is fairly chatty in the chat room, but we are serious about the organization's party. Hopefully, we can invite many people.	”
—Jaehee Kang, Comment from RFA Orientation Guidebook***

> **Jaehee Kang** is one of the characters available from the Casual Story option in Mystic Messenger, and the only female character with a route. She is the chief secretary in the C&R International company and works as Jumin Han's assistant. She is kind and hardworking.
